Online Voting System

This C++ program implements an online voting system using a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage candidates and their votes. The system allows users to:

Add candidates
Register voters
Cast votes
Display candidate votes
View voters in the queue
See voted candidates
Sort candidates by votes
The code showcases effective use of data structures, error handling, and a user-friendly menu. It serves as a foundation for building a functional and interactive voting system.

To use, compile the main.cpp file and run the executable.
